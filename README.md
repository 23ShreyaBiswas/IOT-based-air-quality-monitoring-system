# IOT-based-air-quality-monitoring-system
We will monitor the Air Quality and will
trigger an alarm when the air quality goes down beyond a certain level, means when there
are sufficient amount of harmful gases are present in the air like CO2, smoke, alcohol, benzene
and NH3,it will show the air quality in PPM on the LCD so that we can monitor it very
easily.The alarm will set to alert the user to switch on appliances (exhaust fan, Fan) to
remove excess of gas from the room or cabin and maintain the air quality at a certain range.
We are using an MQ135 sensor because it is the best choice for monitoring air quality as
it can detect most of the harmful gases and can measure their amount in the sample/air
accurately.
